# Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
Step-by-step implementation plan for emoji-linter, broken down into manageable, testable phases that build upon each other systematically.

## Engineering Principles Applied
- **Foundation First**: Core functionality before features
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each plan produces working, testable component
- **Clear Dependencies**: No circular dependencies between plans
- **Simple Engineering**: Solve one problem well at a time

- **Deliverables**: action.yml, GitHub integration, bundled distribution
- **Success Criteria**: Works in GitHub workflows, PR comments, <30s execution
- **Dependencies**: Plans 01-04 (CLI tool complete)
- **Risk Level**: Low (wrapper around existing functionality)

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance
Comprehensive testing and validation across all scenarios.

**Plan 06: Testing and Validation** (2-4 days)
- **Status**: ⏳ Pending (blocked by Plans 01-05)
- **Scope**: Test suites, performance validation, cross-platform testing
- **Deliverables**: Complete test coverage, performance benchmarks, CI/CD integration
- **Success Criteria**: 95%+ coverage, all performance targets met, cross-platform compatibility
- **Dependencies**: Plans 01-05 (all components)
- **Risk Level**: Low

## Timeline Estimation

### Optimistic Timeline (12-15 days)
- **Week 1**: Plans 01-03 (Foundation + Configuration)
- **Week 2**: Plans 04-05 (CLI + GitHub Action)
- **Week 3**: Plan 06 (Testing + Polish)

### Realistic Timeline (15-20 days) 
- **Days 1-5**: Plan 01 (Emoji Detection Engine)
- **Days 6-8**: Plan 02 (File System Scanner)
- **Days 9-11**: Plan 03 (Configuration System)
- **Days 12-15**: Plan 04 (CLI Implementation)
- **Days 16-18**: Plan 05 (GitHub Action Wrapper)
- **Days 19-22**: Plan 06 (Testing and Validation)

### Pessimistic Timeline (20-25 days)
- Account for edge cases, debugging, and refinement
- Additional time for performance optimization
- Buffer for unexpected complexity
